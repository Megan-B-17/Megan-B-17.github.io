# Introduction

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of <strong>global child mortality rates</strong> for ages 5-9, using recent <strong>UNICEF data</strong>. Through a series of <strong>visualizations</strong>, we explore how mortality rates have <strong>changed over time</strong>, how they <strong>differ by country and region</strong>, and what <strong>factors</strong> may contribute to these disparities. The report also examines the <strong>relationship between economic development and child mortality</strong>, as well as <strong>differences by gender</strong>, to highlight areas where <strong>targeted interventions</strong> are most needed.

# Key Findings

- <strong>Child mortality rates</strong> show substantial <strong>variation across countries and regions</strong>, with some countries experiencing rates several times higher than others.
- While <strong>global mortality rates have declined</strong> over recent decades, progress has been <strong>uneven</strong>, and significant <strong>disparities persist</strong>, especially in <strong>low-income regions</strong>.
- <strong>Socioeconomic status</strong>, <strong>healthcare access</strong>, and <strong>education</strong> are strongly associated with lower child mortality rates, as shown by the <strong>negative correlation between GDP per capita and mortality</strong>.
- <strong>Gender differences</strong> in child mortality are <strong>minimal at the global level</strong>, but continued monitoring is important to ensure <strong>equity</strong>.

# Trend Analysis

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Load data
child = pd.read_csv('unicef_indicator_1.csv')
meta = pd.read_csv('unicef_metadata.csv')

# Get the most recent GDP per capita for each country
meta_gdp = meta.dropna(subset=["GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$)"])
meta_gdp = meta_gdp.sort_values("year").groupby("country", as_index=False).last()

# Filter for 2022, total
child_2022 = child[(child['time_period'] == 2022) & (child['sex'] == 'Total')]
# Merge with most recent GDP per capita
merged = pd.merge(child_2022, meta_gdp[['country', 'GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$)']], on='country', how='left')
merged = merged.dropna(subset=['GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$)', 'obs_value'])
# Remove zero or negative GDP values
merged = merged[merged['GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$)'] > 0]
# Take log of GDP per capita
merged['log_gdp'] = np.log10(merged['GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$)'])

# Prepare regression
X = merged['log_gdp'].values.reshape(-1, 1)
y = merged['obs_value'].values
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)
y_pred = model.predict(X)

# Scatter plot with regression line
fig_gdp = px.scatter(
    merged,
    x='log_gdp',
    y='obs_value',
    hover_name='country',
    title='Child Mortality Rates by Log(GDP per Capita) (2022)',
    labels={
        'log_gdp': 'Log10(Most Recent GDP per Capita, constant 2015 US$)',
        'obs_value': 'Mortality Rate (per 1000 children)'
    }
)
# Add regression line
fig_gdp.add_traces(px.line(
    x=merged['log_gdp'],
    y=y_pred,
    labels={'x': 'Log10(Most Recent GDP per Capita, constant 2015 US$)', 'y': 'Predicted Mortality Rate'}
).data)
fig_gdp.update_traces(line=dict(color='red'), selector=dict(type='scatter', mode='lines'))
fig_gdp.update_layout(
    showlegend=False,
    height=500,
    margin=dict(l=40, r=40, t=60, b=60),
    plot_bgcolor='white',
    paper_bgcolor='white'
)
fig_gdp.show()
```

**Analysis:**

The scatterplot demonstrates a clear <strong>negative correlation</strong> between a country's <strong>economic prosperity</strong> (as measured by <strong>GDP per capita</strong>) and its <strong>child mortality rate</strong>. Countries with <strong>higher GDP per capita</strong> tend to have much <strong>lower mortality rates</strong>, indicating that <strong>economic development</strong> is a key factor in improving child health outcomes. The <strong>log scale</strong> on the x-axis highlights that the greatest reductions in mortality are seen as countries move from <strong>low to middle income</strong>. However, some countries <strong>deviate from this trend</strong>, suggesting that other factors, such as <strong>healthcare quality</strong>, <strong>conflict</strong>, or <strong>policy</strong>, also play important roles. This visualization underscores the importance of both <strong>economic growth</strong> and <strong>targeted health interventions</strong>.

# Time Series Analysis

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

df = pd.read_csv('unicef_indicator_1.csv')
trend = df[df['sex'] == 'Total'].groupby('time_period')['obs_value'].mean().reset_index()

fig_time = px.line(
    trend,
    x='time_period',
    y='obs_value',
    title="Global Mortality Rate Trend Over Time",
    labels={"obs_value": "Average Mortality Rate (per 1000 children)", "time_period": "Year"},
    markers=True
)
fig_time.update_traces(line=dict(width=3, color='#4F6D7A'))
fig_time.update_layout(
    height=500,
    margin=dict(l=40, r=40, t=60, b=60),
    plot_bgcolor='white',
    paper_bgcolor='white'
)
fig_time.show()
```

**Analysis:**

The time series line chart reveals a <strong>steady and substantial decline</strong> in <strong>global child mortality rates</strong> for ages 5-9 over the past several decades. This <strong>downward trend</strong> reflects major improvements in <strong>public health</strong>, <strong>nutrition</strong>, <strong>disease prevention</strong>, and <strong>access to medical care</strong> worldwide. While the overall pattern is positive, the chart also shows <strong>periods of slower progress</strong> and occasional <strong>plateaus</strong>, which may correspond to <strong>global crises</strong> or <strong>regional setbacks</strong>. <strong>Sustaining and accelerating this progress</strong> will require continued investment and attention, especially in countries where declines have stalled.

# Global and Regional Comparison of Averages of Child Mortality Rates

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

df = pd.read_csv('unicef_indicator_1.csv')
latest_year = df.groupby('country')['time_period'].max().reset_index()
df_latest = pd.merge(df, latest_year, on=['country', 'time_period'])
df_latest = df_latest[df_latest['sex'] == 'Total']

fig_map = px.choropleth(
    df_latest,
    locations="country",
    locationmode="country names",
    color="obs_value",
    hover_name="country",
    color_continuous_scale="Reds",
    title="Most Recent Global Child Mortality Rate by Country",
    labels={"obs_value": "Mortality Rate (per 1000 children)"},
    height=520
)
fig_map.update_layout(
    coloraxis_colorbar=dict(
        orientation='h',
        x=0.5,
        xanchor='center',
        y=-0.18,
        len=0.7,
        thickness=16,
        title_side='top',
        title_font_size=14,
        tickfont_size=12
    ),
    margin=dict(l=10, r=10, t=60, b=60),
    plot_bgcolor='white',
    paper_bgcolor='white'
)
fig_map.show()
```

**Analysis:**

The world map visualization highlights <strong>stark geographic disparities</strong> in <strong>child mortality rates</strong>. <strong>Sub-Saharan African countries</strong> are shown in the darkest shades, indicating the <strong>highest mortality rates</strong>, while countries in <strong>Europe</strong>, <strong>North America</strong>, and parts of <strong>Asia</strong> have the <strong>lowest rates</strong>. This pattern reflects differences in <strong>healthcare infrastructure</strong>, <strong>economic development</strong>, and <strong>social stability</strong>. The map also reveals that some countries have made <strong>significant progress</strong>, while others continue to face <strong>persistent challenges</strong>. These findings emphasize the need for <strong>region-specific strategies</strong> and <strong>international support</strong> to address the most affected areas.

# Gender Disparities in Averages of Global Child Mortality Rate

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

# Load data
child = pd.read_csv('unicef_indicator_1.csv')
latest = child[child['time_period'] == 2022]
# Only keep Male and Female
avg_by_gender = latest[latest['sex'].isin(['Male', 'Female'])].groupby('sex', as_index=False)['obs_value'].mean()

# Gender-oriented color palette
gender_colors = ['#1f77b4', '#e377c2']  # blue for Male, pink for Female

fig_gender = px.bar(
    avg_by_gender,
    x='sex',
    y='obs_value',
    color='sex',
    text=avg_by_gender['obs_value'].round(2),
    title='Child Mortality Rates by Gender (2022)',
    labels={'obs_value': 'Average Mortality Rate (per 1000 children)', 'sex': 'Gender'},
    color_discrete_sequence=gender_colors
)
fig_gender.update_traces(textposition='outside')
fig_gender.update_layout(
    showlegend=False,
    height=500,
    margin=dict(l=40, r=40, t=60, b=60),
    plot_bgcolor='white',
    paper_bgcolor='white'
)
fig_gender.show()
```

**Analysis:**

The bar chart compares <strong>average child mortality rates</strong> for <strong>boys and girls</strong> in 2022. The results show that the rates are <strong>nearly identical</strong>, with only a very <strong>slight difference between genders</strong>. This suggests that, at the <strong>global level</strong>, <strong>gender-based disparities</strong> in child mortality for ages 5-9 are <strong>minimal</strong>. However, it is important to note that this global average may mask <strong>differences within specific countries or regions</strong>, where <strong>cultural, social, or economic factors</strong> could lead to greater disparities. <strong>Ongoing monitoring</strong> and <strong>disaggregated data</strong> are essential to ensure that both boys and girls have <strong>equal opportunities for survival and health</strong>.

# Conclusion

This report demonstrates that while <strong>global child mortality rates have declined</strong>, significant <strong>disparities remain</strong> across <strong>countries, regions, and genders</strong>. The visualizations underscore the importance of <strong>economic development</strong>, <strong>healthcare access</strong>, and <strong>targeted interventions</strong> in reducing mortality. <strong>Continued investment</strong> in healthcare, education, and <strong>region-specific policies</strong> is essential to ensure all children have the opportunity to <strong>survive and thrive</strong>, regardless of where they are born or their gender.
